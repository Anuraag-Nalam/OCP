# OCP

This is an E-commerce website which is built using django as the backend framework and i have done the front end in html,css,javascript and bootstrap which
includes several styles such as navigation bars, cards etc. This is a typical E-commerce website in which i have indluded several pages such as checkout,
COntatc Us, tracker and about us.

The items which will be ordered will be displayed in the checkout page along with the total amount where after clicking
the submit button the customer id is automatically generated and using this customer id, he will come to know the details of his order and the arrival date in
the tracker page. I have also integrated paytm into my website from where customer can transfer money to my account. I have created a merchant id in order
to do that.
